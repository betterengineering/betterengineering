### 👋 Hello there!
I have a decade of software engineering experience sprinkled across [@DataDog](https://github.com/datadog), [@tidbyt](https://github.com/tidbyt), [@Squarespace](https://github.com/Squarespace), and [@facebook](https://github.com/facebook). Outside of work, I am currently discovering what it means to be a parent. I am really happy in the kitchen cooking or outdoors on my bike. I'd love to meet up for a coffee, find my info below 👇.
