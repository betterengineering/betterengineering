### 👋 Hello, friend!
I'm Mark, and I'm delighted you've found your way here! I'm an ardent coder and tech enthusiast, currently illuminating the world through LED pixels [@tidbyt](https://github.com/tidbyt). My tech journey has taken me from shaping server backends [@Squarespace](https://github.com/Squarespace) to supporting AI advancements [@facebook](https://github.com/facebook). Quite a ride it's been!

Beyond the world of 1s and 0s, I'm excited about: 🚴‍♂️ navigating the vibrant cityscape on two wheels, ☕ brewing the perfect cup of coffee, 🍸 mixing signature cocktails, ⛺ absorbing the tranquility of nature, and 🍳 creating culinary masterpieces.

Don't hesitate to reach out – I'm always up for delving into these topics, and I'm curious to discover what fuels your fire 🔥.
