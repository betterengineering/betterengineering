### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mark, thanks for swinging by! I spend most of my time these days working on [@tidbyt](https://github.com/tidbyt). Formerly, I spent some time supporting AI [@facebook](https://github.com/facebook) and building server backends [@Squarespace](https://github.com/Squarespace). If we get a chance to chat, I want to talk about bikes, coffee, cocktails, camping, cooking, and the thing youâ€™re most passionate about.
